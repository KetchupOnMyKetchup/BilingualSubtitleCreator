1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Okay, let's try something else.

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
From the beginning. Ready. One, two, three.

3
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
One, two, three, checkers. Keep the rhythm.

4
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
One, two, three, checkers. Keep the rhythm.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Okay, it's dai.

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
One, two, three...

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
One, two, three, knocks. Keep the rhythm.

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Wait a minute! What are you laughing at? It's true, the horse got carried away a little, and that's good!

9
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Look, I remember once my dad took me to a jazz club, and I didn't want to go at all.

10
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
But I saw the pianist and he was playing the fourths with an accent.

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then!

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
But I saw the pianist and he was playing the fourths with an accent.

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And then, a minor key, then he added an internal theme and it was like, it was like he sang.

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I got dirty the next thing I saw was like chili, it swept onto the stage.

15
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
He was lost in the music, he was in it, and he took us all there.

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And I wanted to learn to speak like that.

17
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
That's when I realized I was born to play.

18
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Connie understands me. Don't you, Connie?

19
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I am 12.

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm coming back now. Practice the scales.

21
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Excuse me for interrupting the class.

22
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
No worries, you're good.

23
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Not.

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
How can I help, Director Roy?

25
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I wanted to personally tell you the good news.

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You are no longer a paid employee, but the conductor of the Polenstadt orchestra.

27
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Secure job, medical insurance, pension.

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That's great.

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Welcome to the 70th School family, Joe.

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Permanently.

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Thanks to.

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Come on.

33
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
After so many years, my prayers were heard.

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Work of Fullstadt.

35
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
We have workshops, great.

36
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yes, Mom, but I...

37
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You're going to tell them yes, right?

38
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
No need, Mom, I have a plan.

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You don't have a plan.

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Maybe you also need a backup plan for when your plan fails.

41
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
We can educate you to become a middle-aged man who washes himself in a dyed-in-the-wool toilet.

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And walk around with a hole in my pants.

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yes, but...

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
With this job, you will be able to put an end to random commitments.

45
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Everyone knows we need more teachers.

46
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Just in thoughts. Music will finally become your real career.

47
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You're going to tell them yes. Right?

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Please say yes.

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yes, of course.

50
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Okay.

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Hello?

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
How are you, Mr. G? It's Rochelle. Lamont, Lamont Baker.

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Hello, Rochelle! It's good to hear your voice.

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yeah, look, you can call me Joe Rocheleau. I'm not your teacher anymore.

55
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Okay, Mr. Garner. Here's what?

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I am the new drummer in Dorothea Williams' whirlwind.

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and we start the tour from half a note until dinner.

58
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Dorothea Williams, are you kidding? Congratulations, boy!

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I would die a happy man,

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
if I could play with Dorothea Williams.

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Today is the happy day.

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Okay!

63
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Here it is! Hello, Rochelle!

64
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Leon, deserted city. This is not much of a problem.

65
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes, obviously. I'm glad you came.

66
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yes, he played with you last year in Brooklyn.

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
She thinks you're great.

68
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You know, we played in a cafe, right?

69
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Hey, Dorothea!

70
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
This is the man I was telling you about.

71
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The conductor of our school orchestra, Mr. Gardner.

72
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Call me Joe Dorothea.

73
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I mean, I meant Miss Williams.

74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's an honor for me.

75
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Wow, that's great.

76
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Joe is Ray Gardner's son.

77
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Oh, we got to the school conductor.

78
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Well, come on, teacher.

79
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
We don't have all day.

80
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What are you, Rome?

81
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Tori, Tori, Tori.

82
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Sorry, I got a little carried away.

83
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Joe Gardnar, where have you been?

84
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Well, I led the school orchestra, but on the weekends...

85
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Do you have a suit?

86
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
From...

87
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Find yourself a suit, a nice suit.

88
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Well, buddy, see you tonight, the show is at 9, the sauna at 7.

89
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Then we will hear you.

90
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yes!

91
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Woo-hoo!

92
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Life is a beautiful card!

93
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Oh, that's glorious!

94
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Well, go ahead, go ahead!

95
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Do you know where it might be written there?

96
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Joe Gardnar!

97
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

98
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You have to believe what's happening!

99
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I did it!

100
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Everyone is my hips!

101
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Yes!

102
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yes, I know, I know!

103
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Dorothea Wieners!

104
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Can you imagine?

105
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Hey, man!

106
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That you greet me!

107
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Just don't tell mom about the goal!

108
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Is that so?

109
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
We got lost!

110
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I am the jukebox!

111
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm Dorothea Wieners, friend!

112
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Do you understand me?

113
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I am...

114
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm sorry!

115
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What?

116
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Echo!

117
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Echo!

118
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Echo!

119
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Echo!

120
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Look at him!

121
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So, how are you?

122
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Copic J is the Force!

123
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,800
How could they give it without a price?!"

124
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,800
But how?

125
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,800
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, ho!

126
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,800
Oh, hello!

127
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
Oh, what's your name, darling?

128
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
I'm Joe, Joe Gardner.

129
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,800
Look, I'm not supposed to be here.

130
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,800
Oh, your accident happened suddenly.

131
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,800
Look, Joe, I'm 106 years old now.

132
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800
I've been waiting for this for a long time.

133
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Who is Velikod Otvod?

134
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
Velikod Beyond?

135
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,800
Like... like the afterlife?

136
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
Yes.

137
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,800
And that's death over there?

138
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
Hey, Viano, you're on a mental health kick.

139
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,800
It's rewarding, isn't it?

140
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,800
No, no, no. Look, I'm not a participant. I can't die now.

141
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
I don't think you have a say in the matter.

142
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
Yes, yes, I have it.

143
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,800
I won't die the day I get a chance.

144
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
It was time. No, I was even late.

145
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,800
I'm getting out of here.

146
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
I don't think you're allowed to go here.

147
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,800
You can't be.

148
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
I won't die today.

149
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,800
My life has just begun.

150
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,800
What is this? Wait!

151
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,800
I'm not finished, I have to go back.

152
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,800
I don't want to die.

153
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
I'm not ready, I'm not ready.

154
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
Run! Why don't you run?

155
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
No! What's going on?

156
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,800
Murren, today I want.

157
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,800
I'm not ready.

158
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,800
Oh, no, no!

159
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
Oh, I think they are!

160
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
No, no, no!

161
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
I'm not ready!

162
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
No, get out!

163
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
Oh no!

01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:56,800
But what can haunt a soul that has not lived?

378
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,800
There she is! There! Take a good look!

379
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,800
22!

380
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,800
The network! Now!

381
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:25,800
Whipped!

382
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:28,800
That's Peter!

383
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,800
The captain always buys his own food!

384
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,800
The laundry was drowning!

385
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:35,800
22!

386
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,800
Come back, 22!

387
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,800
I am Cho!

388
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,800
Quietly, 22, quietly!

389
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:43,800
I'm back!

390
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:45,800
Just to give you this!

391
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:49,800
Kloko!

392
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,800
22, listen! Come back!

393
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:59,800
And for the correction of errors of distraction and justification,

394
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:04,800
We are now presenting this trophy to you, as you requested.

395
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:09,800
It is a pleasure for me to accept this award that I requested,

396
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:11,800
but I absolutely deserve it.

397
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:15,800
Jockgarder?

398
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:17,800
I take that back.

399
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:22,800
Oh, no! You don't belong here!

400
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,800
Aaaaa

401
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:28,800
Aaa!

402
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:36,800
22, stop! I have to tell you something...

403
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:38,800
I was there, at...

404
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:40,800
Not?

405
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:43,800
22!

406
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,800
Oh, mothers! I'm getting excited...

407
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:49,800
Worried... Don't worry.

408
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,800
Oh, don't run, please. Go!

409
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:54,800
22, stop!

410
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,800
Listen to me, I was wrong!

411
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:00,800
Listen to me. You're ready to live 22.

412
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:16,800
Not for long. No. No profit. He has to pay the last debt.

413
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:18,800
22!

414
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:21,800
You are dishonest! You always make bad decisions!

415
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:23,800
You are not wise and will not illuminate a trace.

416
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,800
Nobody wants to be near you.

417
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:29,800
You always make bad decisions!

418
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,800
You are not wise and will not illuminate a trace.

419
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:34,800
You will never find a place to stay.

420
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:36,800
You've got it.

421
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:38,800
Just don't cover it up.

422
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:41,800
The following key is 34.

423
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:43,800
You will never find a place to stay.

424
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:45,800
It makes no sense.

425
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:47,800
This is not for goals, go ahead and do it.

426
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:49,800
It's just ordinary.

427
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:51,800
This is a waste of time.

428
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,800
You got that bump just because you were in my body.

429
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:55,800
That's why I'm taking everything off.

430
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,800
Because you have no purpose.

431
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:17,800
It makes no sense.

432
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:19,800
You will never find a place to stay.

433
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:23,800
Because you have no purpose.

434
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:26,800
Because you won't find a place to stay.

435
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:30,800
Nothing.

436
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:32,800
Nothing.

437
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:34,800
Nothing.

438
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:36,800
Just to fill the last gap.

439
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:38,800
I surrender.

440
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:51,800
Are you ready?

441
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:53,800
To live.

442
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:59,800
I'm scared, Joe. I'm not good enough,

443
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:04,800
And I didn't find my Spark either.

444
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:09,800
Against.

445
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:14,800
The spark is not your goal. The last circle,

446
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:19,800
that it fills up when you are ready to live.

447
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:25,800
It's that you're great at jazz.

448
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:55,800
But, Joe, that means you won't...

449
01:26:55,800 --> 01:27:00,800
Don't worry, I've already lived. Now it's your turn.

450
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:10,800
I will come with you.

451
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:15,800
You know you can't.

452
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:20,800
Egger!

453
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:50,800
Ahaha!

454
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:20,800
It's that you're awesome.

455
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:50,800
Mr. Gardner.

456
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:55,800
Yes?

457
01:28:55,800 --> 01:29:00,800
Can I have a minute?

458
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:05,800
I think I speak for all of Jerry when I say. Thank you.

459
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:10,800
For what? Our job is to inspire, Joe.

460
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:15,800
Is that so?

461
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:20,800
That's why we decided to give you another chance.

462
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:25,800
Yes, but watch where you go from now on.

463
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:30,800
But, ami Terry...

464
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:35,800
Согласувахме го с Тэрри.

465
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:40,800
I don't know what you're saying.

466
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:45,800
It doesn't matter.

467
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:50,800
Thanks to.

468
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:55,800
Yes, what are you planning to do? How are you going to spend your life?

469
01:29:55,800 --> 01:30:00,800
I'm not sure.

470
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:05,800
But...

471
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:10,800
I will live every minute.

472
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:35,800
Okay!

473
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:35,800
Okay!

474
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:40,800
Okay!

475
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:05,800
Okay!

Okay!

Okay!

Okay!

479
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:45,800
Okay!

Okay!

Okay!

Okay!

483
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:06,800
Okay!

484

Okay!

Okay!

Okay!

Okay!

488

Okay!

489

Okay!

490
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:40,800
Okay!

491
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:05,800
Okay!

492
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:10,800
Okay!

493
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:35,800
Okay!

494
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:40,800
Okay!

495
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:05,800
Okay!

496
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:10,800
Okay!

497
